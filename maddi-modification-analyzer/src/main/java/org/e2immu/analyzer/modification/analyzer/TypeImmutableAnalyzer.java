Phase 4.1

Given the modification and independence state of the fields of a type, compute its @Immutable properties.
This analyzer computes @Immutable across all subtypes, because the fields are visible across the subtypes,
hence their modification and independence status is shared.

It is possible to have to wait for other type's @Immutable status, because of extensions and non-private fields.
