/**
 * <b>A KDoc link must not cost the member its reference edge.</b> {@code ComputeCallGraph.doRecordedReferences} adds
 * a front-end-recorded reference to a TYPE only when the member has no edge to it yet, and its own comment gives the
 * reason: "a type named in a signature or a supertype list already has its D or H edge and naming it is not a use".
 * A DOC edge is neither. {@code doJavadoc} runs first, so a member that <em>documents</em> {@code [Task]} and then
 * uses it where the desugared CST keeps no element — inside a lambda passed to a library function — ended with a doc
 * edge and no reference edge at all: it named Task, and "who refers to Task" could not say so.
 * <p>
 * Both functions here use {@code Task} in the same dropped position and neither names it in its signature; only the
 * KDoc differs. The undocumented one is the control: it was always green, which is what makes the other one's
 * emptiness a suppression rather than a missing record.
