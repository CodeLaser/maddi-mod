/**
 * The first <b>Kotlin</b> corpus test: the JVM slice of <a href="https://github.com/coil-kt/coil">coil</a>'s
 * {@code coil-core}. The Java corpus tests ({@code TestGuava}, {@code TestFernflower}, … in
 * {@code maddi-run-openjdk}) resolve their checkout the same way, via {@link TestOssCorpus}.
 *
 * <h2>Why a slice, and why this slice</h2>
 * Coil is <b>Kotlin Multiplatform</b>, not Kotlin/JVM: 445 {@code .kt} files, zero {@code .java}, targeting
 * JVM, Android, JS, wasmJs and native/Apple. Two things follow.
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>One target only.</b> {@code KotlinProjectScan} builds its K2 session on
 *   {@code JvmPlatforms.defaultJvmPlatform}, so Android (which additionally needs {@code android.jar}), JS,
 *   wasmJs and native are out of reach. Leaving several targets in would also give one FQN several
 *   {@code actual} declarations — {@code TestExpectActual} only proves the {@code expect} is dropped when a
 *   single {@code actual} remains.</li>
 *   <li><b>The hierarchy is flattened.</b> The JVM target's six main source sets ({@code commonMain},
 *   {@code nonAndroidMain}, {@code nonJsCommonMain}, {@code nonAppleMain}, {@code jvmCommonMain},
 *   {@code jvmMain}) become ONE maddi {@link SourceSet} with six source directories — which is what a
 *   {@code compileKotlinJvm} invocation would itself yield, since the hierarchy source sets have no compile
 *   of their own. All six are required: {@code commonMain} carries {@code expect} declarations whose
 *   {@code actual}s live in the others. The same shape as {@code TestKotlinStdlibParse}, which flattens the
 *   stdlib's {@code commonMain} + {@code jvmMain}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Where the input configuration comes from</h2>
 * Neither documented route produces one for coil. The Gradle plugin keys on {@code org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm},
 * the java plugin's {@code SourceSet} container and the {@code compileKotlin} task, none of which a
 * multiplatform build has; and {@code --compile-log} needs the build to run, which needs an Android SDK for
 * AGP. So {@code test-oss/coil/inputConfiguration.json} is assembled directly (recipe:
 * {@code corpus/}'s {@code task config:coil}). It lists only the six library jars — the JDK is not in
 * it, because both {@link KotlinInspector} and {@code MixedProjectInspector} take {@code jdkHome} from the
 * running JVM's {@code java.home}.

        // 136 placeholders in 46 of 186 types, 91 of 1,457 members (`new T[n]` array constructors), via block-bodied
        // computed getters (139/46/94), for-loop destructuring (141/46/96), array loads/stores and `String.get`
        // (143/46/97), captured types/`map.keys`/`entries`/enum `entries` (154/46/102), and the cache-fix baseline
        // itself (159/48/107; see requireCompleteConfig, which now refuses a configuration missing a jar — earlier
        // cache-starved numbers, 283 down through 367/69/195 at 29e951ea1 and 371/71/197 at fbe6b138a, measured a
        // stale Gradle cache and are not comparable). The other, independently, measured 282 at ca6be1333 (a Java
        // instance-field fix) from the SAME 29e951ea1/fbe6b138a starting point, noting the drop from 367 was not
        // fully attributed or bisected. Both fix chains are combined in this merge; re-measured below.
        // Re-measured 2026-09-24 on that merge plus values named through a type (qualified/imported enum constants and
        // nested objects, companion `@JvmField`/`const`, `String.format`), all six jars present: 119 placeholders in
        // 43 of 186 types, 82 of 1,457 members. Then 113 in 41 / 76 (`AutoCloseable.use`, function-typed properties
        // and receiver-typed parameters invoked; vararg binding and intrinsic calls left coil at 119); 106 in 40 / 69

        // (infix primitive members as Java operators); 102 in 38 / 65 (bound extension references as lambdas).
        // Re-measured 2026-09-25 with the six fragment directories as a dependsOn chain of K2 modules instead of one
        // flat module (an `expect` and its `actual` had been rival declarations K2 resolved neither of; a call to an
        // `expect` fun now goes to its actual's facade): 29 placeholders in 18 of 186 types, 26 of 1,458 members.
        // Then 8 in 5 / 7: a callee renamed by `@JvmName` called by its JVM name (okio's `Path.div` is `resolve`,
        // `String.toPath` is `get`, `FileSystem.read`/`write`), `x in 0.0..1.0` as two comparisons, arithmetic on a
        // boxed primitive, a `try` alone in a value-`if` branch, `removeAt` as `List.remove(int)`. Then 4 in 2 / 4:
        // an extension `componentN` in a destructuring, a companion's member extension through its singleton, a
        // reference to a member of the enclosing extension's receiver. The 4 left are reified `T::class`, refused.
