/**
 * The second Kotlin corpus, and the one that exercises what {@link TestCoilJvmSlice} cannot.
 *
 * <p>Where coil is Kotlin Multiplatform — forcing a hand-assembled configuration covering one flattened
 * source set — detekt is a plain multi-module Kotlin/JVM Gradle build. That means two firsts:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>its {@code inputConfiguration.json} comes from the <b>{@code --compile-log}</b> route, so
 *   {@code ParseKotlincList} + {@code CompileListToSourceSets} are exercised against a real build for the
 *   first time: 32 {@code kotlinc} invocations become <b>31 source sets</b> linked by output identity, with
 *   82 library jars and generated-source directories (buildConfig, kotlin-dsl accessors) picked up;</li>
 *   <li>it is a genuine <b>multi-source-set</b> parse — {@code detekt-core} alone depends on 18 others —
 *   whereas coil is one set, so cross-source-set resolution in dependency order is under test here.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Roughly 1,000 {@code .kt} files against coil's 101. detekt has no compiled Java at all (its nine
 * {@code .java} files are test <i>resources</i>).
