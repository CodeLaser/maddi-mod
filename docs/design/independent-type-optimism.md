# `INDEPENDENT_TYPE` can be permanently optimistic

**Status: FIXED 2026-09-24 (`5011ecf99`).** `computeIndependentType` now returns `null` (wait) while a
type's own fields or abstract methods are undecided, in every mode, not only after-mark; cycle breaking
still decides a type that never settles. The same commit stopped the shallow pass from writing a
synthesized `INDEPENDENT` that ignored inherited methods. Pinned by
`TestIndependenceNotWrittenWhileUndecided`. The fallout this note predicted did happen: E7 shape 4 and
`TestShadowModificationPass.testBuilderCallback` were re-pinned, and both now carry the false positive
`ThrowingFunction.apply:0:o` described in
[`../defects/sam-linking-reconciliation.md`](../defects/sam-linking-reconciliation.md). The fix was taken
anyway, accepting that false positive rather than keeping the wrong type-level verdicts: on the corpus,
guava independence moved down 345 and up 13, vavr down 75. What follows is the original record,
kept because code cites it for the rule "no optimistic default for an undecided input".

**Original status: reproduced defect, not fixed.** The obvious fix is correct but unmasks a second, independent
inconsistency; see "Why the obvious fix is not enough". Found while building eventual immutability
(`../design/eventual-immutability.md`), which is how the asymmetry became visible.

## The defect

`TypeIndependentAnalyzerImpl.computeIndependentType` ends with

```java
return indyFromHierarchy.min(fromFieldsAndAbstractMethods);
```

and `Value.min(null)` returns the receiver (`v == null || compareTo(v) <= 0 ? this : v`). So when
`loopOverFieldsAndAbstractMethods` returns `null` — its way of saying *undecided*, set whenever a field's
`INDEPENDENT_FIELD` or an abstract method's `INDEPENDENT_METHOD` has not been decided yet — the result
silently becomes `indyFromHierarchy`, which for a type with no supertypes is `INDEPENDENT`.

"We do not know yet" is thereby read as "independent": the optimistic direction. `go()` writes that value,
and `TolerantWrite.setAllowControlledOverwrite` enforces monotonicity, so the later, correct DEPENDENT is
refused. The type stays independent forever.

## Reproduction

`TestEventualPropagation`'s `INPUT7` fixture, on an unmodified tree:

```java
interface I {
    @Mark("t") void commit(String s);
    @Only(before = "t") List<String> leak();
}
static class Impl implements I {
    private final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    @Override public List<String> leak() { return list; }
}
```

Measured:

```
type I    INDEPENDENT_TYPE=@Independent   IMMUTABLE_TYPE=@FinalFields
  m leak  INDEPENDENT_METHOD=@Dependent
type Impl INDEPENDENT_TYPE=@Dependent     IMMUTABLE_TYPE=@Mutable
  m leak  INDEPENDENT_METHOD=@Dependent
```

`I` is `@Independent` while its own abstract method `I.leak()` is `@Dependent` — an interface that hands
out a `List<String>`. `loopOverFieldsAndAbstractMethods` returns DEPENDENT the moment it sees a dependent
abstract method, so the type-level value cannot have been computed from a settled `leak()`; it was decided
in an earlier iteration, while `leak()` was still undecided, and frozen there.

Note the asymmetry: the class `Impl` is correct. Only the interface is poisoned, because an abstract
method's `INDEPENDENT_METHOD` arrives late — it is copied up from implementations by phase 6
(`AbstractMethodAnalyzerImpl.methodIndependent`), after the type analyzers have already run.

### A self-confirming loop, not just one bad value

The optimistic value feeds back. On `TestModificationFunctionalE7`'s `INPUT4`:

```
type TryData     indep=@Independent  imm=@Immutable(hc=true)
  m throwingFunction  INDEPENDENT_METHOD=@Independent
type TryDataImpl indep=@Independent  imm=@Immutable(hc=true)
  m throwingFunction  INDEPENDENT_METHOD=null        <- never decided at all
```

`TryDataImpl` is a class with a `private final ThrowingFunction` field returned directly by an accessor —
a textbook dependent accessor — yet it is reported `@Immutable(hc=true)`. The type was promoted while its
accessor was undecided; the promotion made the type immutable; an accessor returning an immutable type is
independent; which confirms the type. The accessor's own value is then never needed, and stays `null`.

With the loop broken (see below) the honest values appear: `TryData` and `TryDataImpl` become
`@Dependent`, `TryDataImpl` becomes `@Mutable`, and `TryDataImpl.throwingFunction()` resolves to
`@Dependent`.

## Why the obvious fix is not enough

The obvious fix is to wait — `return null` when `fromFieldsAndAbstractMethods == null` — which is exactly
what `TypeImmutableAnalyzerImpl` does at the corresponding spot (`loopOverFieldsAndMethods == null`), and
`go()` already has the deliberate cycle-breaking answer for a value that never arrives (it writes
INDEPENDENT under `activateCycleBreaking`). A null there costs an iteration, not a verdict.

It produces correct independence, and it breaks two tests, both on E7 shape 4:

- `TestModificationFunctionalE7.test4`: `run`'s modified set grows from
  `run:0:td, run` to `ThrowingFunction.apply:0:o, run:0:td, run`.
- `TestShadowModificationPass.testBuilderCallback`: `unmodifiedParameter ThrowingFunction.apply:0:o`
  becomes a main-vs-shadow divergence, breaking the "correctly-analyzed code must diff clean" invariant.

The chain is: correct (pessimistic) independence → `TryData` no longer immutable → the conservative
marking at the opaque SAM application `td.throwingFunction().apply(td)` is no longer immutable-guarded →
`apply:0:o` enters `run`'s modified set → the shadow pass, walking reachability, concludes `apply:0:o` is
modified, while the main pass's `UNMODIFIED_PARAMETER` says it is *not*.

**Main is right and the new seed is a false positive.** `ThrowingFunction.apply` is realized only by the
method reference `this::methodBody`, and `methodBody` never touches its parameter. The two passes
disagree because the engine holds two contradictory conventions for a SAM with no registered
implementations:

- `AbstractMethodAnalyzerImpl.doMethodWithoutImplementation` forces its parameters unmodified/independent
  (optimistic — nothing is known, so nothing is assumed to happen);
- the link computer conservatively marks the argument of an opaque application modified (pessimistic).

`IMPLEMENTATIONS` is populated from `methodInfo.overrides()` (`MethodAnalyzer`), so a SAM satisfied only
by a lambda or method reference genuinely has none. That is by design, not a bug — which is why this
contradiction cannot be fixed by populating `IMPLEMENTATIONS`.

While `TryData` was wrongly immutable, the contradiction was invisible: the immutable guard suppressed the
conservative marking. Fixing independence removes the mask.

### The narrowing does not dodge it

An attractive narrowing — wait only when an abstract *method* is undecided, keep concluding when only
fields are — does not help. In `TryData` the undecided element *is* the abstract method
`throwingFunction()`, so the narrowing produces the same result and the same fallout.

## Options

1. **Reconcile the two SAM conventions first, then fix independence.** The principled order. Either
   `doMethodWithoutImplementation` stops forcing optimistic values for a SAM that is actually applied
   somewhere, or the link computer stops seeding the formal parameter of an implementation-less abstract
   method. Both change modification results beyond this defect and want the corpus proving ground.
2. **Fix independence and accept the new E7 shape**, updating both tests. Rejected here: it would enshrine
   a false positive (`apply:0:o` is demonstrably not modified) and, worse, would silence a real
   main-vs-shadow inconsistency by editing the invariant that exists to catch it.
3. **Make the optimistic value revisable** rather than frozen — i.e. let this particular write escape
   `TolerantWrite`'s monotonicity. Rejected: monotonic overwrite is a deliberate engine invariant
   (`../design/analysis-rewiring.md`); subverting it locally trades a wrong value for an unstable one.

Option 1 is the recommendation.

**Update (2026-07): option 1 was tried and rejected on measurement.** Reconciling the SAM conventions by
stopping `doMethodWithoutImplementation`'s optimistic `UNMODIFIED_PARAMETER` write does resolve the
main-vs-shadow contradiction on the E7 fixture, but it concedes to the pessimistic side rather than the
correct one: `TestModificationFunctionalE7.test4`'s false positive survives, and on the clone-bench
corpus the pinned main-vs-shadow divergence count *rises* (215 → 216) while removing none of the
existing 215. Details and the revised recommendation (option 3, deriving SAM parameter modification from
the lambdas actually bound at capture sites) are in
[`../defects/sam-linking-reconciliation.md`](../defects/sam-linking-reconciliation.md).

So the independence fix here remains **withheld**, for the same reason as before: it is correct, but it
unmasks a false positive that no currently-available reconciliation removes.

## Scope of the damage today

Anything downstream of `INDEPENDENT_TYPE` on an *interface* (or any type whose fields/abstract methods
settle late) can be over-optimistic: `IMMUTABLE_TYPE` via the independence gate in
`computeImmutableType`, and everything derived from it. Concrete types are largely unaffected, as `Impl`
above shows. Eventual immutability is affected only indirectly — it reads the same gate — and its own
after-mark path already waits instead of concluding, precisely to avoid inheriting this bug
(`TypeIndependentAnalyzerImpl.computeIndependentType`, the `!afterMark.isNone()` branch).
