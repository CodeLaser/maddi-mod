/**
 * Kotlin port of `modification-prepwork` `TestAssignmentsFieldAccess`: a compound assignment (`+=`) on an
 * instance field reads *and* assigns its target.
 *
 * The Java suite's other cases have no faithful Kotlin form and are not ported: an indexed compound assignment
 * (`a[i] += v`) desugars through Kotlin's `get`/`set` operator convention, so no `a[i]` dependent variable is
 * produced; a nested field assignment (`a.b.c = ...`) resolves through property getter/setter calls, so there is
 * no `a`/`b`/`c` field-variable to track; and the static-field case would need a `companion object`, which
 * changes the enclosing structure.
