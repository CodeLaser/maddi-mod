# sv engine — catalogue of the 144 remaining link failures

Snapshot at `eaf67350` (`sv-integration`), full `:maddi-modification-link:test` run.
Baseline was 196; the reconstruct work (see `sv-engine-handoff.md` → STATUS UPDATE)
brought it to **144/383**. This is the current, categorised to-do.

> **Instability — diagnosed and fixed.** Earlier, two full runs disagreed on ~40 of the
> 144 (which tests fail flipped run-to-run). Root cause: **not** the engine — a *serial*
> run is byte-identical across repeats. It was `maxParallelForks = 4` + JVM-global state
> that leaks across test *classes* within a fork, so the (non-deterministic) class→fork
> assignment changed the accumulated state. **Fix:** `forkEvery = 1` in `build.gradle.kts`
> (fresh JVM per class) — two parallel runs are now byte-identical **and** match the serial
> baseline (0 flips). The 144 below is the canonical, reproducible set. (Latent note: a
> method's links still depend on JVM-global state — `forkEvery=1` isolates it at class
> granularity but the underlying leak is worth eliminating for true purity.)

## Top-line breakdown

| category | count | meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| **Assignment/identity re-baselines** | **60** | only `←`/`→`/`≡` differ — the intended semantic change (assignment is now group membership, not an edge; `sv-semantic-differences.md` §1). **Not bugs** — regenerate expectations. |
| **Structural diffs** | **72** | `∈`/`⊆`/`∩`/`~`/`≺`/`≻` differ, or same natures with different vars/order. Mix of intended broadenings (§3–5) and real gaps. |
| **Crashes** | **5** | one cause: `SharedVariable.acceptForLinkedVariables()` throws `UnsupportedOperationException`. |
| **Engine unit tests** | **3** | `TestEngine`, `TestLabeledGraph`, `TestClosureWitnessIndex` — isolated engine assertions. |
| **Empty summary** | **4** | return summary fully lost (`--> -`). |

Dropped-nature histogram (expected − got): `←`×100, `≡`×28, `∈`×19, `≺`×9, `→`×6,
`∩`×6, `∋`×4, `⊆`×4, `≥`×3, `≻`×2, `~`×1. Spurious: `∩`×6, `⊆`×5, `≡`×5, `≈`×4,
`←`×3, rest ≤2. The `←`/`≡` dominance is the re-baseline signature.

## Per-class map (reb = assignment re-baseline, str = structural)

| class | reb | str | empty | crash | note |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| TestLanguageConstructs | 9 | 6 | | 2 | broad mix + 2 crashes (labeled break/continue) |
| TestStaticValuesRecord | 11 | 1 | | | almost pure re-baseline |
| TestSupplierSpec | 8 | 2 | | | mostly re-baseline (FI supplier) |
| TestList | 2 | 6 | | | structural (collection HC) |
| TestLinkMethodCall | 4 | 4 | | | the spec — split |
| TestSupplier | 6 | 1 | 1 | | mostly re-baseline |
| TestStream | | 6 | | | **all structural** (stream HC flow) |
| TestBoundTypeParameter | 1 | 5 | | | **structural** (type-param HC) |
| TestStaticBiFunction | 3 | 3 | | | split |
| TestVarargs | | 4 | | | structural — missing varargs `∩` fan-out |
| TestForEachLambda | | 4 | | | structural (FI consumer) |
| TestStreamBasics | | 3 | 1 | | structural |
| TestDependent | | 3 | | | structural (Iterable.iterator `∈` lost) |
| TestArrayAccess | | 3 | | | structural |
| TestLinkModificationArea | | 3 | | | structural |
| TestMap | | 1 | | 2 | 2 crashes + `∋`→`∩` coarsening |
| TestSwitchExpression | 1 | 2 | | | |
| TestStaticValues1 | 3 | | | | re-baseline |
| TestFunction | | 2 | | | Optional `∈` lost |
| TestStaticValuesMerge / TestStaticValuesIndexing | | 2 each | | | structural |
| TestGetSet / TestCast / TestLinkTypeParameters | 2 each | | | | re-baseline |
| ~18 more classes | | | | | 1 each (see run) |
| **TOTALS** | **60** | **72** | **4** | **5** | + 3 engine |

## Real bugs (vs intended re-baselines)

Most of the 60 (and a share of the 72) are intended re-baselines: assignment→group
(§1), broadened `valid()` making `≺`/`≻` first-class (§5), `∈?`/`∋?` candidates (§4),
score-directed `∩`/`≥` (§3). Those need **expectation regeneration**, read-to-confirm.

The genuine remaining defects cluster:

1. **~~`acceptForLinkedVariables()` crash~~ DONE (crashes removed, not counts).**
   Implemented to `return false` (the rep is synthetic; its members are expanded
   separately) — the 5 `UnsupportedOperationException`s are gone. But the underlying tests
   still fail: they are **2-D array / `∈∈` / large-JSON** cases (`TestMap`×2,
   `TestLanguageConstructs` labeled break/continue over `g[0][0]`, `TestWriteAnalysis2`),
   now clean assertion-fails in the structural bucket. `expandRepToMembers` was also
   extended to array (`DependentVariable`) scopes for symmetry with the field branch — no
   test delta yet; groundwork for the array cluster.
2. **Return-summary-lost (4 empty + several structural-empty).** `method∈0:list.§ts → -`
   in `TestDependent` (`Iterable.iterator`), `TestFunction`/`TestSupplier` (`Optional`) —
   residual field-of-rep / FI-lift reconstruct gaps in the functional-interface path.
3. **Varargs `∩` fan-out (`TestVarargs`×4).** `0:target.§is∩1:collections.§iss`
   consistently dropped.
4. **Map coarsening (`TestMap` test1b).** `§vs∋value` expected, `§vs∩…` got — residual
   `∋`→`∩` coarsening in the Map hidden content.
5. **Stream / bound-type-parameter HC (`TestStream`×6, `TestBoundTypeParameter`×5).**
   All-structural clusters; focused pass.
6. **3 engine unit tests** — check against the engine directly, separate from linking.

## Suggested attack order

0. ~~Order-stability~~ **done** (`forkEvery = 1`; see the instability note above).
1. `acceptForLinkedVariables` (5 crashes, one fix).
2. Regenerate the 60 assignment/identity re-baselines per class (mechanical, read-to-
   confirm) — drops the visible count ~40%.
3. Return-summary-lost cluster (FI/Optional/iterator).
4. Varargs `∩` and Map `∋` coarsening.
5. Stream / bound-type-parameter structural pass.

## How this snapshot was produced

`./gradlew :maddi-modification-link:test -PskipCloneBench`, then parse
`build/test-results/test/*.xml`: bucket each `<testcase>` with a `<failure>`/`<error>`
by (a) thrown vs assertEquals, (b) for assertEquals, the multiset diff of nature symbols
between `expected:` and `but was:` (only `←/→/≡` differ ⇒ re-baseline; else structural;
empty RHS ⇒ empty).
